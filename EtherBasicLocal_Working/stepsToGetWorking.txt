truffle console
send_me_money.deployed().then(instance => {con = instance})

con.take("EDCTtMsuQvECFZBuHr65vkqmaEgcwc9Bvx3wfT2Umabs",{from: web3.eth.accounts[2], value: 1e18, gas: 100000})
con.take("EDCTtMsuQvECFZBuHr65vkqmaEgcwc9Bvx3wfT2Umabs",{from: web3.eth.accounts[2], value: 100000, gas: 100000})
